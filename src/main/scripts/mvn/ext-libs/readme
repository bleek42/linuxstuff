Before deploy a new release for ext-libs you have to remove the '-SNAPSHOT' tagging from the pom.xml files.

This is the order to care for the '-SNAPSHOT' tagging:

- mvn-parent-projects
- mvn-java-parent
- vintage-time
- gen-tree
- test-objects
- net-extensions
- silly-collections
- jcommons-lang
- file-worker
- xml-extensions
- resourcebundle-inspector
|- email-tails
- mystic-crypt
|- design-patterns
|- swing-components
